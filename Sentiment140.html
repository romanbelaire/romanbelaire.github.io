This neural network is aimed at analyzing the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 Million tweets from random users in the year 2009. My goal is to detect the positive or negative sentiment displayed 
by each tweet, using a long-short term-memory neural network, or LSTM. This blog will be a little different than my previous two, as I am writing it while I am doing the project, instead of after. The first step, 
as with any dataset, is to import the data and look at how we will approach it. The Sentiment140 dataset contains several features, of which we will use two: Tweet, User, Time, Tweet Number, and Sentiment. The 
two we care about are the Tweet (which we will look at to determine sentiment) and Sentiment (which is our measure of correctness).
