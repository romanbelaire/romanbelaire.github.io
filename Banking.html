The banking project was my first intro into building my own artificial neural networks. I followed a tutorial from the SuperDataScience team in a Udemy course, which used the Keras and Tensorflow 
libraries to predict outcomes on a set of banking information. The dataset included values describing customers of a bank, including their country of origin, value of their account, years active and 
several other features commonly associated with bank accounts, for a total of 13 features. Our goal was to predict whether or not a member would terminate their accounts given the features.

<div class = "p1">
Most of these features are relevant, except "Row ID", "Customer ID" and "Surname", so the dataset was changed to reflect that. Using the SciKit-Learn library, I had to encode the categorical 
data to something a neural network could process. The gender column only had two possibilities, so this could be converted to a binary output. Geography contained a small range of values, so 
OneHot encoding was the way to go. This created one new column for each unique category, and set the corresponding column to "1" for each row.

	#encoding categorical data
	from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
	labelencoder_X_1 = LabelEncoder() #for countries
	X[:, 1] = labelencoder_X_1.fit_transform(X[:, 1])

	labelencoder_X_2 = LabelEncoder() #for gender
	X[:, 2] = labelencoder_X_2.fit_transform(X[:, 2])
	
	onehotencoder = OneHotEncoder(categorical_features = [1])
	X = onehotencoder.fit_transform(X).toarray()

<div class = "p1">
Once the data was ready to go, it was time to build the neural network model. Using the Keras Sequential model, I added the following layers: 
<div class = "p2">
<ul><li>Input layer, with 12 dimensions</li><li>Hidden layer, which will allow the network more opportunity for optimization</li><li>Output layer, with 1 output dimension (our answer)</li></ul>
</div>

</div>

<div class = "p1">
<pre>
	<code class = "language-python" contenteditable spellcheck = "false" style = "font-size: 18px;">
	classifier = Sequential() #initialize
	#input layer
	classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 6, init = 'uniform', activation = 'relu', input_dim = 12))
	#hidden layer
	classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 6, init = 'uniform', activation = 'relu'))
	#output layer
	classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 1, init = 'uniform', activation = 'sigmoid'))
	</code>
</pre>
</div>
<div class = "p1">
After that, it was time to compile and fit this model to the data! The tutorial I was following compiled it with batch size 5 over 60 epochs, and I found I was able to get a *slightly* more 
accurate model by using a batch size of 7 over 50 epochs. My accuracy for this model was 86.7%.
</div>
<div class = "p1">
<pre>
	<code class = "language-python" contenteditable spellcheck = "false" style = "font-size: 18px;">
	#Compile it
	classifier.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

	#fit ANN to the training set
	classifier.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 7, epochs = 50)
	</code>
</pre>
</div>
<div class = "p1">
Overall, this project was fairly straightforward. Most of the hangups I had were debugged within a decent timeframe, and I actually ended up with a higher accuracy than the tutorial model.
